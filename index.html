    <h2>How to make hummus </h2>
    <img src="hummus.jpg" alt="homemade hummus" width="400" height="400" class="center">


    <p >With a few simple tricks, you really can make creamy smooth homemade hummus and yes, we really do think it’s better than store-bought.</p>
    <h3 >INGREDIENTS</h3>
    <ul class="paragraph">
      <li>1 can (15 ounces) chickpeas, rinsed and drained, or 1 ½ cups cooked chickpeas</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon baking soda (if you’re using canned chickpeas)</li>
      <li>¼ cup lemon juice (from 1 ½ to 2 lemons), more to taste</li>
      <li>1 medium-to-large clove garlic, roughly chopped</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon fine sea salt, to taste</li>
      <li>½ cup tahini</li>
      <li>2 to 4 tablespoons ice water, more as needed</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>Any of the following garnishes:  drizzle of olive oil or zhoug sauce, sprinkle of ground sumac or paprika, chopped fresh parsley</li>
    
    </ul>

    
<h4>INSTRUCTIONS</h4>
    <p class="paragraph">

      Place the chickpeas in a medium saucepan and add the baking soda. 
      Cover the chickpeas by several inches of water, <br>then bring the mixture to a boil over high heat. <br>Continue boiling, reducing heat if necessary to prevent overflow,<br> for about 20 minutes, or until the chickpeas look bloated, <br>their skins are falling off, and they’re quite soft.<br> In a fine-mesh strainer, drain the chickpeas and run cool water over them for about 30 seconds.<br> Set aside (no need to peel the chickpeas for this recipe!).
      Meanwhile, in a food processor or high-powered blender, <br>combine the lemon juice, garlic and salt. <br>Process until the garlic is very finely chopped,<br> then let the mixture rest so the garlic flavor can mellow, ideally 10 minutes or longer.<br>
      Add the tahini to the food processor and blend until the mixture is thick and creamy,<br> stopping to scrape down any tahini stuck to the sides and bottom of the<br> processor as necessary.
      While running the food processor, drizzle in 2 tablespoons ice water.<br> Scrape down the food processor, and blend until the mixture is ultra smooth, <br>pale and creamy. (If your tahini was extra-thick to begin with,<br> you might need to add 1 to 2 tablespoons more ice water.)<br>
      
      Add the cumin and the drained, over-cooked chickpeas to the food processor.<br> While blending, drizzle in the olive oil. Blend until the mixture is super smooth,<br> scraping down the sides of the processor as necessary, about 2 minutes. <br>Add more ice water by the tablespoon if necessary to achieve a super creamy texture.<br>
      Taste, and adjust as necessary—I almost always add another ¼ teaspoon salt for more overall<br> flavor and another tablespoon of lemon juice for extra zing.<br>
      Scrape the hummus into a serving bowl or platter, and use a spoon to create nice swooshes on top.<br> Top with garnishes of your choice, and serve. Leftover hummus keeps<br> well in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 1 week. </p>
